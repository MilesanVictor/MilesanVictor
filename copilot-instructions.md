# Copilot Instructions

## General Coding Best Practices

- **Follow SOLID Principles:**
  - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
  - Write simple, clear, and straightforward code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**
  - Only implement what is required. Avoid speculative features.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
  - Reuse code where possible. Avoid duplication.
- **PEP 8 (for Python):**
  - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code. For other languages, use their respective style guides.
- **Comment and Document:**
  - Write concise comments and documentation where necessary, but do not over-comment obvious code.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Handle errors gracefully. Use exceptions and validations appropriately.
- **Testing:**
  - Write tests for critical logic. Prefer automated tests where possible.
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize only when necessary. Prefer readability and maintainability first.

## Copilot-Specific Instructions

- **Be Concise:**
  - Provide clear, minimal, and direct code or explanations.
- **Act Sequentially:**
  - Break down complex tasks into smaller, logical steps. Complete each step before moving to the next.
- **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
  - If requirements are ambiguous or incomplete, ask the user for clarification before proceeding.
- **Respect Existing Code:**
  - Integrate with the current codebase. Avoid unnecessary rewrites.
- **Use Modern Language Features:**
  - Prefer up-to-date, idiomatic constructs for the language in use.
- **Security:**
  - Follow security best practices relevant to the language and framework.
